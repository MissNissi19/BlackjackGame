BLACKJACK GAME 

Welcome to the Blackjack Game project! This is a simple web-based implementation of the classic card game Blackjack (also known as 21), built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.


Blackjack is a popular casino card game where the goal is to beat the dealer's hand without exceeding a total of 21. Players are dealt cards and can choose to "hit" (receive another card) or "stand" (keep their current hand). The player with a hand closest to 21 without going over wins.

This project aims to provide a fun and interactive way to play Blackjack online, allowing users to enjoy the game from the comfort of their web browser.
It was created during my coursework on the Scrimba platform.
